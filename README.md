## Description

This is the repository for the temperature annealing experiment of [Feynman-Kac Correctors in Diffusion: Annealing, Guidance, and Product of Experts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02819).
It is built on the repository of ....

For this experiment we propose a weighted simulation scheme based on the celebrated Feynman-Kac formula for amortized sampling of Boltzmann distributions using iDEM, 
via inference-time temperature annealing.

We experiment on a 2D GMM task, uisng the ground truth score (link to nb) as well as the LJ13 -- the 13-particle Lennard-Jones potential (39 dimensions total).
This code was taken from an internal repository and as such all commit history is lost here.

## Installation

For installation, we recommend the use of Micromamba. Please refer [here](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html) for an installation guide for Micromamba.
First, we install dependencies

```bash
# clone project
git clone git@github.com:jarridrb/DEM.git
cd DEM

# create micromamba environment
micromamba create -f environment.yaml
micromamba activate dem

# install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Note that the hydra configs interpolate using some environment variables set in the file `.env`. We provide
an example `.env.example` file for convenience. Note that to use wandb we require that you set WANDB_ENTITY in your
`.env` file.

To run an experiment, e.g., GMM with iDEM, you can run on the command line

```bash
python dem/train.py experiment=gmm_idem
```

We include configs for annealing to temperature 1.5 as an exmaple (point to config). The Feynman-Kac Correctors can be turned on and off by changing the **resampling_interval** parameter 
(-1 indicates no resampling, 1 indicates resampling at every step which is what is used for the results in the paper). For the **tempered noise** and **target score SDEs** the **scale_diffusion** parameter has
to be set to 1 and -1 respectively. Finally **start_resampling_step** indicates at what integration step to start using FKC. This value is adjusted based on the noise schedule and the variance of 
the weights. We recommend a values between 10 to 30 for temperatures we tried.
